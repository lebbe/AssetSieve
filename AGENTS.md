# Code structure

- no semicolon
- singlequote
- prefer functions: `export function nameOfFunction() {}
- also for react components: export function ComponentName({prop1, prop2}: Props) {}

# Code checking

Ask me to check the result when you are done, instead of running all kinds of commands for building and running tests.
